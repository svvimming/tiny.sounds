suddenly in a field with a very particular consistency with not enough communication; with brushes-nestles-and-ears-that-lean-way-in tinies !pop!bounce! into a new world. let me say now the best thing to know is that tiny.sounds like to be massaged. if the pop-bounce were like a frog jumping out of a bog, massaging could in fact be confused with reaching into the bog and feeling the bottom of the bog. however-- you'll notice that the reach is not so far and your hands are inside of the frog (or something like that) and in fact your hands are no longer hands. it is all about that feeling. massage this frog- let me describe what we're dealing with here better it is not a frog, it is a heavy shapeshifter, a momentum. the momentum swings to the rhythmresonance of itself then explodes, (it turns out it only needed to be a frog to bounce out of the bog) this explosion is not messy as it was before it became a frog this explosion the explosion does not spread it goops, it goops to its singular momentum now full of smooth-sharp-slap variation. the goop does not shape or fill but it boogies to a dance that is so good that you think you've known it all along. and in a way you have but you've never met it before. this is not a changechange more a besidebeside
